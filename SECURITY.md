## Supported versions

While this package is pre-1.0 only the **latest published minor** is
maintained. Security fixes land on `main` and ship in a PATCH
release within a few days.

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 0.1.x   | ✅                 |
| older   | ❌ — upgrade first |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security problems.**

Email **phpcraftdream@gmail.com** with:

- A short description of the vulnerability.
- Steps or a snippet to reproduce it (Ktav input that triggers the
  behaviour, the affected API, expected vs actual).
- The ktav version you observed it on (JAR coordinates /
  `Ktav.nativeVersion()` output is usually enough), plus the JDK, OS
  and arch so we know which prebuilt `ktav_cabi` was in use.
- Your disclosure timeline preference, if you have one.

You should get an acknowledgement within **72 hours**. A published
fix typically follows within **a week** for high-impact issues, longer
if the fix needs to coordinate with the Rust crate or the format spec.

## Scope

Issues that count as security problems for this package:

- Out-of-bounds reads / writes or panics in the native `ktav_cabi`
  shared library that crash or hang the host PHP process. The library is
  loaded via FFI (`Native.load`), so a native crash tears down the
  whole PHP process — no Java-side `catch` can stop it.
- Runaway memory or CPU when parsing crafted input.
- Incorrect FFI memory handling (double-free, missing free, reading
  freed buffers across the `ktav_free` boundary).
- Any behaviour that allows crafted Ktav input to escape the expected
  value-domain (arbitrary code execution in the loaded library,
  uninitialised-memory disclosure, etc.).
- A download-time vector: `NativeLoader` fetches the prebuilt
  binary from the matching GitHub Release. Reports about TLS /
  integrity-check gaps in that path belong here.

Issues that are **not** security problems here — please use regular
issues for these:

- Performance regressions without crash / hang characteristics.
- Behavioural mismatches that aren't exploitable.
- Problems in the Ktav format itself — those belong in
  [`ktav-lang/spec`](https://github.com/ktav-lang/spec).
